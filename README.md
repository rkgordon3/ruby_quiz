There's no correct way to                                                                                                      
solve this, and take as much time as you need...we're just trying to                                                           
get a look at your coding style and thought process.                                                                           
                                                                                                                               
Given a list of words (`./words`), generate two output

sequence of four letters that appears in exactly one word of the                                                               
dictionary, one sequence per line.  'answers' should contain the                                                               
corresponding words that contain the sequences, in the same order,                                                             
again one per line.

'arro' wouldn't show up in 'questions', because it appears in two words

I hope that's clear enough.  Let me know if you have any questions.                                                            
Also, if you have any other code samples you'd be willing to share,                                                            
I'd really appreciate it.
